				"content_html": "<p>About a month ago, I ordered something on Amazon that was a food item (maybe pecans?) and, on the way to checkout, I was asked whether I wanted to add things like 33-cent avocados (!!!!!), milk, or bananas to the order.

I added other items to get to the $25 minimum. I was offered a choice of 2 delivery windows: 5p-9p that evening, or 4a-8a the next morning. The items were exactly what I ordered and showed up on time.</p>\n<p>I learned later that Amazon is testing this service, included for Prime members, in select cities (San Francisco being one of them). The goal is to compete with companies like Instacart and Wal-Mart, which apparently also offers grocery delivery.</p>\n<p>I never use Instacart because it ends up being more trouble than just going to the store. Even if I add substitutions for every item and detailed instructions when I make my list, the shopper ends up texting incessantly during the trip (while I’m in meetings, which is always), half the time things on my list are unavailable, and some of the subsitutions are wrong. Amazon didn’t contact me at all during shopping, and presumably, they know exactly what is in stock when you order it.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great experience, and I’ve used it a few times. I know Amazon is evil, but life is challenging, and this is a very useful tool in a pinch. I actually enjoy going to the grocery store, and there are both a Safeway and a Whole Foods within walking distance of my house.

				"content_html": "<p>This show is such a gem, and I want it to get the attention it deserves! It’s written by Lena Dunham and her husband as a semi-autobiographical story about their relationship. It stars <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Stalter\">Meg Stalter from “Hacks,”</a> who is hilarious, although it’s not a straight-up comedy – there are plenty of dramatic and poignant scenes. It made me cry multiple times.</p>\n<p>I feel like the show got some negative reviews from people who don’t like Lena Dunham and used the opportunity to work out their own issues about her, or people who were expecting it to be more of a comedy, but I think <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/too-much-tv-review-netflix\">this New Yorker review</a> was pretty accurate.</p>\n<p>Part of why I loved it is that it’s ultimately a show that very effectively communicates how we all have a lot of baggage from our childhoods, past relationships, etc., and often what we think of as those special “you know it when you meet THE ONE” romantic feelings are the result of being drawn to partners who help us heal that damage, even if we’re not necessarily conscious of it.</p>\n<p>I also like the way it portrayed flawed characters who are capable of change – both Jessica and Felix are very flawed, as are most of the people in their orbits – but the show doesn’t condescend to any of them, and doesn’t “punish” them for their issues. Instead, it portrays them all as deserving of love and friendship (honestly, even Zev). The show also illustrates the way that people we think of as “villains” in our own personal stories may have a very different perspective. I thought the Wendy character arc was particularly satisfying and surprising.</p>\n<p>Finally, it was wonderful to watch a female character who is not a size 2, but has a positive self-image and is not insecure about her weight. She’s also ambitious and very good at her job, which again, is unusual for shows with young women at the center.</p>\n<p>The writing is excellent, and it’s definitely not a “two screen” show – there is a lot of subtlety in the dialogue and reactions that is easy to miss. I watched it through twice, because so much of it is told in flashbacks, and I picked up a lot of nuances the second time around, after I knew what was going to happen.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, the soundtrack is incredible, and there are a ton of charming cameos. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant\">Richard E.

The best part is that I love my team at Chime, and know that this is an exciting beginning for the company. I can't wait to see what we do next! \n\n",

But we shall see. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2025/67611875e4.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" alt=\"\">\r\n",

				"content_html": "<p>It came to my attention recently that some people still use Facebook. I was a very early adopter of Facebook (as I am for most things), but stopped using it years ago. I have a fake profile I set up when we adopted our greyhound puppy, because that was the only place the rescue group was posting photos, but no one can find me or friend me and I don’t use it to post anything, just to keep up with that group and foster homes that may be needed.</p>\n<p>My decision to stop using Facebook wasn’t just because it was destroying America and helped get Tr*mp elected, but because I had accumulated so many “friends” over a very turbulent time in my life, and it felt weird to “unfriend” them, but it also felt overwhelming to see so many updates on the lives of people I had no actual connection with anymore. In a weird way, it made me both (1) guilty for not keeping in touch with them, and (2) anxious that if I ran into them on the street I’d forget I’d seen an update that they had a baby or started a new company or whatever, and I’d reveal that I don’t actually care about what’s happening in their lives anymore.</p>\n<p>I generally like social media as a way to keep in touch with friends and family I don’t see often. I did Friendster, and MySpace, and some of the others I’ve forgotten (Orkut? Was that a thing?). But none of them held up over the long term.</p>\n<p>I stopped using Twitter when Elon bought it, and I like Bluesky and Mastodon, but I mostly use those to follow strangers and post my own dumb thoughts for strangers. It doesn’t feel “social” because it isn’t people I actually socialize with. I tried out Threads, but it felt extremely Facebook-coded, and I soon lost interest.</p>\n<p>I actually like TikTok (it’s GREAT at showing me wildlife rescue and dog training videos I’m going to like), but I don’t really want to watch videos, generally, and I rarely use it.</p>\n<p>I started using Tumblr because, in 2009, pre-iPhone, it was the one service that let me easily post to my photoblog by emailing photos to a specific address from my Palm Treo 650. I still use it for that purpose (but now I use the app!), but I don’t follow other people on Tumblr, or use the app for anything except posting photos. So I don&rsquo;t really consider it a &ldquo;social media platform,&rdquo; since that&rsquo;s not how I use it.</p>\n<p>For me, the last “real” social media platform standing is Instagram. I started using it very early &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ITA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\">this is my first post, from October 2010</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/HR67LVqVSg\">this is the first picture I posted of my now-husband, in February 2012</a>. It’s the one thing I still use, and the only social media platform I&rsquo;ve used for 15 years! I like it for sharing photos with my friends and family (it&rsquo;s really the only site they still post photos on), but I also follow some wildlife rescues, other greyhound and whippet accounts, accounts for organizations like the SFMOMA and the parks department, and interesting celebrities like AOC and Miranda July. If you switch to the “Following” feed by tapping on the Instagram logo in the top left, you don’t get all the nonsense from accounts you don’t even follow. I consider it the only “real” social media platform (at least, for me) because it’s the only place I follow friends and family, comment on their posts, and share photos intended for them (rather than for strangers, which is the case with my photoblogs).</p>\n<p>Why do I like Instagram? I guess because I’ve always taken a lot of photos (since high school, way before digital!), it’s my way of interpreting the world. I’ve heard people say they’ve stopped using Instagram because they didn’t want to take themselves out of the moment by documenting it… but I’ve <em>always</em> documented everything with photos. It doesn’t take me out of the moment, and it’s actually part of my enjoyment of the moment (I mostly take quick candids, I don’t spend time staging or framing anything too elaborately). I like taking pictures, and I like seeing pictures from other people.</p>\n<p>Ryan on Garbage Day summed it up pretty well in <a href=\"https://www.garbageday.email/p/what-is-instagram-now?_bhlid=27c458eba3f97b5783ad2814040a90f25a1ac6dd&amp;utm_campaign=what-is-instagram-now&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_source=www.garbageday.email\">this post</a>. I don’t use Reels or know how to specifically look for Reels on Instagram, but the rest really rang true. I’m genuinely surprised that Instagram has been the one that has stuck around for me, but I still hope we’ll eventually get something better.</p>\n",

But none of them held up over the long term. \n\nI stopped using Twitter when Elon bought it, and I like Bluesky and Mastodon, but I mostly use those to follow strangers and post my own dumb thoughts for strangers. It doesn’t feel “social” because it isn’t people I actually socialize with. I tried out Threads, but it felt extremely Facebook-coded, and I soon lost interest. \n\nI actually like TikTok (it’s GREAT at showing me wildlife rescue and dog training videos I’m going to like), but I don’t really want to watch videos, generally, and I rarely use it. \n\nI started using Tumblr because, in 2009, pre-iPhone, it was the one service that let me easily post to my photoblog by emailing photos to a specific address from my Palm Treo 650. I still use it for that purpose (but now I use the app!), but I don’t follow other people on Tumblr, or use the app for anything except posting photos. So I don't really consider it a \"social media platform,\" since that's not how I use it. \n\nFor me, the last “real” social media platform standing is Instagram. I started using it very early -- [this is my first post, from October 2010](https://www.instagram.com/p/ITA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and [this is the first picture I posted of my now-husband, in February 2012](https://www.instagram.com/p/HR67LVqVSg). It’s the one thing I still use, and the only social media platform I've used for 15 years! I like it for sharing photos with my friends and family (it's really the only site they still post photos on), but I also follow some wildlife rescues, other greyhound and whippet accounts, accounts for organizations like the SFMOMA and the parks department, and interesting celebrities like AOC and Miranda July. If you switch to the “Following” feed by tapping on the Instagram logo in the top left, you don’t get all the nonsense from accounts you don’t even follow. I consider it the only “real” social media platform (at least, for me) because it’s the only place I follow friends and family, comment on their posts, and share photos intended for them (rather than for strangers, which is the case with my photoblogs).\n\nWhy do I like Instagram? I guess because I’ve always taken a lot of photos (since high school, way before digital!), it’s my way of interpreting the world. I’ve heard people say they’ve stopped using Instagram because they didn’t want to take themselves out of the moment by documenting it… but I’ve _always_ documented everything with photos. It doesn’t take me out of the moment, and it’s actually part of my enjoyment of the moment (I mostly take quick candids, I don’t spend time staging or framing anything too elaborately). I like taking pictures, and I like seeing pictures from other people. \n\nRyan on Garbage Day summed it up pretty well in [this post](https://www.garbageday.email/p/what-is-instagram-now?_bhlid=27c458eba3f97b5783ad2814040a90f25a1ac6dd&utm_campaign=what-is-instagram-now&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=www.garbageday.email). I don’t use Reels or know how to specifically look for Reels on Instagram, but the rest really rang true. I’m genuinely surprised that Instagram has been the one that has stuck around for me, but I still hope we’ll eventually get something better. \n",

				"content_html": "<p>I recently started knitting sweaters again, which I hadn&rsquo;t done in about 20 years (I&rsquo;ve still been knitting a bit, but I&rsquo;ve stuck to baby blankets, scarves, and afghans, mostly as gifts).

The pattern is available <a href=\"https://tincanknits.com/pattern/love-note\">here for $9</a>, and what I particularly love about Tin Can Knits is that they have an iPhone app, which allows you to select your size, and then it shows you ONLY the instructions for your size. Super useful, and makes following the pattern much easier.

The color is &ldquo;Luscious Marmalade Lantana.&rdquo; Kelley&rsquo;s yarns are non-superwash merino wool, so they feel great on your hands while knitting, and produce a beautiful garment.

It&rsquo;s knit from the top down, and I had to restart the project 3 times. The first time, I made what, in retrospect, is an obvious mistake: Because the lace pattern consists of increases and decreases that net out to zero each time the repeat completes, I didn&rsquo;t think about the fact that if I ended the pattern in the wrong spot, I might be adding or subtracting a stitch, throwing the entire pattern off.

				"title": "How to Make Perfect Homemade Ice Cream",
				"content_html": "<p>During the beginning of COVID lockdown, I started making homemade ice cream. But, like most homemade ice cream, it wasn’t that great! I LOVE ice cream, so I decided I was going to set out to make the BEST ice cream, better than you can buy in a store. Learning the science and experimenting with different recipes became my COVID hobby.</p>\n<p>More than 400 batches later, I have achieved my goal. Friends tell me I make the best ice cream they’ve ever had. I’m able to\nmake some of my favorite flavors that you can’t buy commercially, like real banana, and unexpectedly delicious combinations, like matcha with Grape-Nuts as a mix-in (trust me!).</p>\n<p>Let’s get a few things out of the way first:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>You need an ice cream maker to make ice cream.</strong> Don’t bother with so-called “no churn” recipes. The texture won’t be good. That being said, a basic freezer-bowl style Cuisinart ice cream machine is fine, and that’s what I started out with. I ended up upgrading to a compressor-style Whynter machine, but only because I wanted to be able to make more than one batch per day and wanted a bowl with a larger capacity. The quality of the ice cream wasn’t any different.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Ice cream, like baking, is based on chemistry.</strong> Each ingredient serves a purpose: Sugar lowers the freezing point, emulsifiers smooth the texture, milk solids give it “body,” fat creates the creamy mouthfeel. You can’t just throw ingredients together in any amount and expect it to come out well. You also can’t try nonsense like leaving out the sugar (unless you want a frozen ice block). If you want to learn more about the science, I highly recommend the book “<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/539038/hello-my-name-is-ice-cream-by-dana-cree/\">Hello My Name is Ice Cream</a>.” The website <a href=\"https://www.icecreamscience.com\">Ice Cream Science</a> is also a great resource.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Once you have a good base recipe, you can learn to adapt it to different flavors.</strong> If you’re just adding a flavor agent, like vanilla, there’s no need to adjust. But if you’re adding, for example, strawberries, you’ll need to account for the fact that strawberries add sugar, non-milk solids, and water, and adjust accordingly. That will come from experience and experimentation. There are also ice cream calculators available online that you can use.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep it simple.</strong> Other recipes will overcomplicate things and tell you to temper the egg yolks, etc. You don’t need to do any of that. Just follow my method. You can get the stabilizers — <a href=\"https://modernistpantry.com/products/locust-bean-gum.html?srsltid=AfmBOorZ2FCEmDwrZxRDniQeo7PZay5A-R7dM6RPITNzrR-Pjv_B0WpN\">Locust Bean Gum</a> and <a href=\"https://modernistpantry.com/products/perfected-guar-gum.html?gad_source=1&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADzbXXl00HIwNQXV5n1cHpAdpOiLg&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw7dm-BhCoARIsALFk4v88ppjsOnYtb5Z_lZYjAlevoc7QjLp_pVSWdHx98D5aBkVyIl60HKIaAiR_EALw_wcB\">Guar Gum</a> — on Amazon, they’re not expensive, or you can use some other stabilizer (I used to swear by Cremodan 30, but they stopped making it). You can also do without any stabilizer, it will just mean the ice cream won’t keep as long in the freezer before it gets icy. I like my batches to last at least a few weeks.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>**Ok, now for the base recipe: **</p>\n<p>This is the “base” recipe all my flavors are built around. I’ll provide some of my specific recipes down below, but with a good base recipe, it provides a solid ground for experimentation. You’ll need a digital kitchen scale and a candy thermometer.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>For certain flavors, prepare the milk and cream a day in advance by bringing it to a boil with the flavoring items (mint leaves, coffee beans, tea, etc.) and letting it sit together in the fridge overnight. Strain out the solids before using the flavored dairy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Separate 3 large eggs (the yolks should be about 60g in weight, total). Just keep the yolks.

				"content_text": "During the beginning of COVID lockdown, I started making homemade ice cream. But, like most homemade ice cream, it wasn’t that great! I LOVE ice cream, so I decided I was going to set out to make the BEST ice cream, better than you can buy in a store. Learning the science and experimenting with different recipes became my COVID hobby. \n\nMore than 400 batches later, I have achieved my goal. Friends tell me I make the best ice cream they’ve ever had. I’m able to\nmake some of my favorite flavors that you can’t buy commercially, like real banana, and unexpectedly delicious combinations, like matcha with Grape-Nuts as a mix-in (trust me!). \n\nLet’s get a few things out of the way first:\n\n1) **You need an ice cream maker to make ice cream.** Don’t bother with so-called “no churn” recipes. The texture won’t be good. That being said, a basic freezer-bowl style Cuisinart ice cream machine is fine, and that’s what I started out with. I ended up upgrading to a compressor-style Whynter machine, but only because I wanted to be able to make more than one batch per day and wanted a bowl with a larger capacity. The quality of the ice cream wasn’t any different. \n\n2) **Ice cream, like baking, is based on chemistry.** Each ingredient serves a purpose: Sugar lowers the freezing point, emulsifiers smooth the texture, milk solids give it “body,” fat creates the creamy mouthfeel. You can’t just throw ingredients together in any amount and expect it to come out well. You also can’t try nonsense like leaving out the sugar (unless you want a frozen ice block). If you want to learn more about the science, I highly recommend the book “[Hello My Name is Ice Cream](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/539038/hello-my-name-is-ice-cream-by-dana-cree/).” The website [Ice Cream Science](https://www.icecreamscience.com) is also a great resource. \n\n3) **Once you have a good base recipe, you can learn to adapt it to different flavors.** If you’re just adding a flavor agent, like vanilla, there’s no need to adjust. But if you’re adding, for example, strawberries, you’ll need to account for the fact that strawberries add sugar, non-milk solids, and water, and adjust accordingly. That will come from experience and experimentation. There are also ice cream calculators available online that you can use. \n\n4) **Keep it simple.** Other recipes will overcomplicate things and tell you to temper the egg yolks, etc. You don’t need to do any of that. Just follow my method. You can get the stabilizers — [Locust Bean Gum](https://modernistpantry.com/products/locust-bean-gum.html?srsltid=AfmBOorZ2FCEmDwrZxRDniQeo7PZay5A-R7dM6RPITNzrR-Pjv_B0WpN) and [Guar Gum](https://modernistpantry.com/products/perfected-guar-gum.html?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADzbXXl00HIwNQXV5n1cHpAdpOiLg&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7dm-BhCoARIsALFk4v88ppjsOnYtb5Z_lZYjAlevoc7QjLp_pVSWdHx98D5aBkVyIl60HKIaAiR_EALw_wcB) — on Amazon, they’re not expensive, or you can use some other stabilizer (I used to swear by Cremodan 30, but they stopped making it). You can also do without any stabilizer, it will just mean the ice cream won’t keep as long in the freezer before it gets icy. I like my batches to last at least a few weeks. \n\n**Ok, now for the base recipe: **\n\nThis is the “base” recipe all my flavors are built around. I’ll provide some of my specific recipes down below, but with a good base recipe, it provides a solid ground for experimentation. You’ll need a digital kitchen scale and a candy thermometer. \n\n1) For certain flavors, prepare the milk and cream a day in advance by bringing it to a boil with the flavoring items (mint leaves, coffee beans, tea, etc.) and letting it sit together in the fridge overnight. Strain out the solids before using the flavored dairy. \n\n2) Separate 3 large eggs (the yolks should be about 60g in weight, total). Just keep the yolks. With bird flu causing supply issues with real eggs, I’ve also used powdered egg yolks and reconstituted them with water per the directions. \n\n3) Prepare an ice bath by nesting a smaller bowl (large enough to hold all the ice cream mixture) in a larger bowl of ice. \n\n4) Add the following dry ingredients in a bowl (put the bowl on the kitchen scale), and stir them together thoroughly:\n- Table sugar: 200g \n- Skim milk powder: 60g\n- 0.8g locust bean gum (1/4 teaspoon)\n- 0.5g guar gum (1/8 teaspoon)\n- Any powdered flavorings you want to use (cinnamon, cardamom, etc.)\n- A pinch of salt\n\n5) Put the following wet ingredients in the saucepan and mix thoroughly:\n- Whole milk: 340g\n- Heavy whipping cream: 460g\n- Light corn syrup: 50g\n- The 3 egg yolks (use a fork or whisk to break them up)\n\n6) Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, whisking constantly, until everything is dissolved. You can use an immersion blender if you feel like it.\n\n7) Put the scale away and get out a candy thermometer. Attach the candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan.\n\n8) Turn on the heat to medium-high and begin stirring almost constantly, with a silicone spatula so that you can keep scraping the sides/bottom, until the temperature reaches 180 degrees (10 minutes or so).**BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERCOOK OR THE EGGS WILL SCRAMBLE!** The temp needs to be raised to 180 degrees to activate the locust bean gum. If you don’t have a candy thermometer, just watch until it starts to steam visibly. If not using stabilizers, you just want to pasteurize the eggs.\n\n9) Turn off heat and continue stirring for a few more minutes to let the mixture thicken.\n\n10) Pour the mixture into the container in your prepared ice bath.\n\n11) Add any liquid flavorings to the mix, like puréed fruit or vanilla extract. \n\n12) If the eggs scrambled a bit or the mixture is otherwise lumpy, hit it with an immersion blender to smooth it out. You can do this anyway if you want to ensure the smoothest texture. \n\n13) Let the ice cream cure in the refrigerator overnight before churning in your ice cream maker according to the instructions. After churning, it should be a soft serve-like, goopy consistency — it will not have the consistency of finished ice cream. \n\n14) After churning, put into your ice cream storage container as quickly as possible, and let it harden in the freezer for at least 4 hours or overnight.

				"content_html": "<p><em>NOTE: I published this elsewhere 10 years ago, on a platform that is now mostly defunct, so thought I would share it again here. I&rsquo;ve updated it a little, but generally all this advice still holds!</em></p>\n<p>I suffered from terrible insomnia for most of my adult life. This topic came up again recently, so I decided I’d finally take the time to write a post about it in hopes that it may help someone. First and foremost, let me note that insomnia is often a symptom of depression and anxiety — and can be related to undiagnosed medical conditions like thyroid dysfunction — so it’s important to talk to a doctor and make sure any underlying conditions are being properly treated first.</p>\n<p>That being said, I suffered for decades trying to get help from more than one doctor and I always got the same condescending nonsense like “try drinking warm milk” and everything else that someone who has been researching this issue for years would&rsquo;ve already tried. To be clear, this piece isn’t intended for people with occasional sleeplessness, for whom “have you tried taking melatonin?” is a reasonable suggestion and not the sort of question that makes you want to scream. This is for people like me who have suffered from serious insomnia for so long that they have become willing to make meaningful life changes to address it.</p>\n<p>This is what worked for me. Your mileage may vary. I think it’s important to know that over the past decade or so, I have significantly changed my life in order to manage both my anxiety and insomnia. I’ve made a lot of changes that will probably seem like too much work for most people. But for me, feeling calm, rested, and energetic most days — I have more energy than I did in my 20s and 30s, even though I’m 50 now — is worth the attendant sacrifices. I also made these changes gradually over the years, not all at once, which made things easier.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are the strategies I employ today:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Exercise-related strategies:</strong></p>\n<p>I wake up at the same time every morning (5:30am) and do an hour of intensive cardio or strength training. This is, by far, the most important part of my strategy. Forget excuses like “I’m not a morning person” (no one is, at 5:30am), “I just can’t” (yes you can), etc. I’ve been doing it for years and it’s still not easy, but what makes it easier is (1) making sure I’m strict about going to bed when I intend to (10pm), (2) going the gym every day rather than just a few times a week (your body eventually gets used to waking up at the same time every day), (3) belonging to a gym right near my work (so I’m able to fully wake up while I’m on the subway) (<em>Update: During COVID I took the opportunity to build out my home gym, and that makes it even easier!</em>), and (4) setting everything up the night before (lay out my gym clothes, pack my work clothes in my gym bag for the next day) so that all I have to do is wake up, throw my gym clothes on, chug some coffee, and walk out the door. Getting my exercise in early ensures that by the end of the day, my body is physically worn out and ready to sleep. If you have to bring kids to daycare or have other reasons morning workouts are impossible for you, try doing it at lunch — any time other than after work, which tends to keep my system “revved up” beyond my intended bedtime.</p>\n<p>I walk the dogs in the evening after work. Unlike my intensive morning workout, this is just a relaxing 15–30 minute stroll around the neighborhood. This helps tire my muscles out just a little bit more and make the transition between work and home. Seeing my pups so excited to get outside helps me shake off whatever minutiae was stressing me out during the workday and focus on what’s important.</p>\n<p>I do a few minutes of yoga before bed. Just before I get into bed to read, I do a few yoga poses that require strength: chair pose, warrior 3, side planks, etc. It helps relax my muscles one final time. I am a person who gets very “fidgety” when I can’t sleep, so tiring myself out physically is key to managing my insomnia.</p>\n<p><strong>Light-related strategies:</strong></p>\n<p>I use a SAD light every morning while I drink my coffee. You can use any light that’s intended to treat SAD (just Google “seasonal affective disorder light therapy” and you’ll get a ton of options). Not as essential in the summer, but key for me in the winter.</p>\n<p>I get natural light during the workday. I make sure I’m experiencing natural light as much as possible during the day. I have my desk next to a window now, but I’ve had to work in cubicles where there was no natural light whatsoever, which made it all the more important to get outside for a walk at lunch. Even 20 or 30 minutes of daylight makes a difference.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategies related to my bedtime habits:</strong></p>\n<p>I have a bedtime ritual that starts 1–2 hours before the time I want to be asleep. During this time I focus on things that are calming or otherwise part of my evening routine: Chatting with my partner about our days, noodling with the guitar, packing my gym bag for the next morning, playing with our dogs. I try to avoid doing anything stimulating or stressful like making phone calls, paying bills, etc.</p>\n<p>I write things down before bed. I keep a gratitude journal on my nightstand and, every night, write down at least 5 things I was particularly grateful for that day. That helps put me in a relaxed, positive frame of mind for sleeping. I have a separate “worry journal” where I write down everything I need to do or am otherwise fretting about that might keep me awake. I tell myself that I can open the notebook and resume worrying about these things in the morning, but for now, I am closing the notebook and putting them aside. These are both just mindfulness rituals that work for me, but different things work for different people. Other rituals that work for people I know: Writing down their worries on little pieces of paper and burning them with a candle, saying a prayer out loud, meditating, drawing a picture that sums up their day.</p>\n<p>I read in bed for up to an hour, in the dark, using either the Instapaper or Kindle apps on my phone with the white-text-on-black-background setting engaged. I hate how some people insist that ALL DEVICES must be verboten before bedtime, or that doing anything in bed — including reading — is a problem. Here’s what I DON’T do for an hour before sleep time (I get in bed at 9pm with the goal of being asleep by 10pm): Surfing the web on my phone or a computer, replying to emails, watching TV, doing anything under bright lights. Here’s what I DO do: Get into bed, turn off the lights, turn off all notifications on my phone, and read a book on my Kindle app with the white-text-on-black-blackground setting engaged. For me, it’s critical to turn off any banner notifications or other distractions that might pop up while I’m reading. All I have access to is the book or article in front of me. I find this helps me fall asleep even more quickly than reading a paper book (or non-backlit Kindle) under dim light. Somehow the total darkness is what signals to my brain that sleep time is coming. I give myself an hour, though, so I am able to relax and lose myself in the story before I start getting anxious that I’m not feeling sleepy yet.</p>\n<p>I sleep with earplugs, a white noise machine, and have very dark window shades. I said at the beginning how this was one of the annoying suggestions, but really: Try keeping the room dark and silent or with white noise only. If you close your eyes at night and find it’s darker than when you had them open, then you need to cut off some sources of light. I have shades that block out the streetlights and neighbors’ backyard lighting, and put black electrical tape over chargers and other devices with lights on them. Other people I know use white noise machines in addition to the earplugs.</p>\n<p><strong>Diet-related strategies:</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t drink alcohol. When I was younger I relied on having a glass or two of wine before bed to help me sleep, but the problem with that is that, like any addictive substance, the amount I “needed” kept increasing. Plus, alcohol disrupts your REM sleep and can wake you up in the middle of the night when the effects wear off. I quit drinking for a variety of reasons, but was surprised to find that one of the benefits was how much better I started sleeping (not at first, but after about 6 months).</p>\n<p>I make lunch my big meal of the day. This helps me avoid eating a large, high-calorie meal right before bed, which can also interfere with sleep. I look forward to a filling and flavorful lunch as my “big meal.” I also block out my work calendar from 12p-1p weekdays, so people don’t try and schedule meetings during that time, forcing me to just grab something on the run.</p>\n<p>Caffeine? This doesn’t apply to me, personally (I drink plenty of coffee!), but some people are particularly sensitive to caffeine due to genetic differences in how they metabolize it. My partner is one of those (I’m not, thank goodness!). He can have a cup of coffee at noon and it will keep him awake 10 or 12 hours later. If you’re reading this, you might try cutting out caffeine temporarily to see if you are one of these people.</p>\n<p><strong>Strategies around medication:</strong></p>\n<p>I took drugs at first, but not Ambien. The two groups of commonly-prescribed drugs, (1) Ambien-type drugs and (2) prescriptions classified as benzodiazapenes (i.e. Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, etc.) are intended for short-term use and quickly lose effectiveness — and the latter are dangerously addictive. Once I finally found a doctor who took my sleep issues seriously, we set about trying to find a non-addictive medication that could help over the long term and was safe for me to take for months at a time. People I know have found success with a first-generation antidepressant called trazodone, but it gave me terrifyingly realistic nightmares that felt like hallucinations (a known side effect). What worked for me was quetiapine fumarate, which is an anti-psychotic that’s used off-label for insomnia. It comes with significant side effects and requires monitoring, but it was worth the risks for me. I was eventually able to taper off of it, but I took it while I was working on other lifestyle changes to get my insomnia under control. My point is that there are non-addictive, non-Ambien options that are available, but the tough part is finding a doctor who takes you seriously and doesn’t give you the same “try taking a warm bath!” nonsense.</p>\n<p>I take melatonin, but I don’t actually know if it does anything. From what I’ve read, melatonin gets destroyed in a person’s stomach, so taking it as a pill that you swallow is much less effective. I get the kind that dissolves under your tongue and take 5mg of it about an hour before bed. I actually don’t know that this helps, but it doesn’t seem to hurt.</p>\n<p><em>(Update: At 50, I&rsquo;m now on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and the 200mg progesterone I take at night really helps with falling asleep quickly too!)</em></p>\n<p><strong>Strategies related to my lifestyle and way of thinking:</strong></p>\n<p>I have a meditation practice and I make it a priority. Mine is part of a larger Buddhist practice focused on letting go of trying to control the world around me and accepting things as they are, which is helpful in reducing general anxiety and, as a result, insomnia. But even on its own, I think meditation is helpful. I try to meditate every day, even if only for 10 minutes, which helps me practice getting my mind into the place of stillness that is helpful when trying to fall asleep. Meditation is great for learning how to quiet the “noisy voices” that would not stop reminding me of everything I needed to do the next day when I was trying to fall asleep. I find the Buddhify app useful for guided meditation.</p>\n<p>I remind myself that not sleeping is not the end of the world. I was raised to think that there were certain rules that had to be followed, and if you followed them all to the letter, your life would be perfect and nothing bad would ever happen to you (that’s how it works, right)? For me, that also applied to getting 8 hours of sleep. If I wasn’t sleeping, I began to have meta-anxiety about getting into bed, and worrying about my insomnia kept me awake. That would’ve been funny if it weren’t so frustrating! Now, when I have the occasional sleepless night, I keep in mind that people with infants, those living in war zones, people who have to work multiple shift jobs, and many others are able to survive on surprisingly small amounts of sleep. Not sleeping for a few nights might make me tired and irritable, and isn’t great for my health, but I will survive, and I will eventually go back to normal sleep patterns. It’s not the end of the world.</p>\n<p>I check the calendar. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that my occasional bouts with intense anxiety always came 1–3 days before my period was scheduled to start. I still typically only get 4 or 5 hours of very light sleep, waking every hour or so, for at least one night during that time. Knowing that it’s just a hormonal issue and that it will pass in a night or two — and being able to anticipate that it was going to happen — made it easier to tolerate.</p>\n<p>I undertook other life changes to address my depression and anxiety. This would be a whole ‘nother post, but I have made many other changes to improve my mental health and which contribute to my feeling more relaxed and less stressed overall, which I have to assume contributed to relieving my insomnia. These include engaging in talk therapy, volunteering, choosing jobs that are not as high-pressure as many in my field, investing in my social safety net by prioritizing making time with old and new friends, and taking steps to simplify my life.</p>\n<p>I hope this helps someone. Good night and good luck.</p>\n",

First and foremost, let me note that insomnia is often a symptom of depression and anxiety — and can be related to undiagnosed medical conditions like thyroid dysfunction — so it’s important to talk to a doctor and make sure any underlying conditions are being properly treated first.\n\nThat being said, I suffered for decades trying to get help from more than one doctor and I always got the same condescending nonsense like “try drinking warm milk” and everything else that someone who has been researching this issue for years would've already tried. To be clear, this piece isn’t intended for people with occasional sleeplessness, for whom “have you tried taking melatonin?” is a reasonable suggestion and not the sort of question that makes you want to scream. This is for people like me who have suffered from serious insomnia for so long that they have become willing to make meaningful life changes to address it.\n\nThis is what worked for me. Your mileage may vary. I think it’s important to know that over the past decade or so, I have significantly changed my life in order to manage both my anxiety and insomnia. I’ve made a lot of changes that will probably seem like too much work for most people. But for me, feeling calm, rested, and energetic most days — I have more energy than I did in my 20s and 30s, even though I’m 50 now — is worth the attendant sacrifices. I also made these changes gradually over the years, not all at once, which made things easier.\n\n**Here are the strategies I employ today:**\n\n**Exercise-related strategies:**\n\nI wake up at the same time every morning (5:30am) and do an hour of intensive cardio or strength training. This is, by far, the most important part of my strategy. Forget excuses like “I’m not a morning person” (no one is, at 5:30am), “I just can’t” (yes you can), etc. I’ve been doing it for years and it’s still not easy, but what makes it easier is (1) making sure I’m strict about going to bed when I intend to (10pm), (2) going the gym every day rather than just a few times a week (your body eventually gets used to waking up at the same time every day), (3) belonging to a gym right near my work (so I’m able to fully wake up while I’m on the subway) (_Update: During COVID I took the opportunity to build out my home gym, and that makes it even easier!_), and (4) setting everything up the night before (lay out my gym clothes, pack my work clothes in my gym bag for the next day) so that all I have to do is wake up, throw my gym clothes on, chug some coffee, and walk out the door. Getting my exercise in early ensures that by the end of the day, my body is physically worn out and ready to sleep. If you have to bring kids to daycare or have other reasons morning workouts are impossible for you, try doing it at lunch — any time other than after work, which tends to keep my system “revved up” beyond my intended bedtime.\n\nI walk the dogs in the evening after work. Unlike my intensive morning workout, this is just a relaxing 15–30 minute stroll around the neighborhood. This helps tire my muscles out just a little bit more and make the transition between work and home. Seeing my pups so excited to get outside helps me shake off whatever minutiae was stressing me out during the workday and focus on what’s important.\n\nI do a few minutes of yoga before bed. Just before I get into bed to read, I do a few yoga poses that require strength: chair pose, warrior 3, side planks, etc. It helps relax my muscles one final time. I am a person who gets very “fidgety” when I can’t sleep, so tiring myself out physically is key to managing my insomnia.\n\n**Light-related strategies:**\n\nI use a SAD light every morning while I drink my coffee. You can use any light that’s intended to treat SAD (just Google “seasonal affective disorder light therapy” and you’ll get a ton of options). Not as essential in the summer, but key for me in the winter.\n\nI get natural light during the workday. I make sure I’m experiencing natural light as much as possible during the day. I have my desk next to a window now, but I’ve had to work in cubicles where there was no natural light whatsoever, which made it all the more important to get outside for a walk at lunch. Even 20 or 30 minutes of daylight makes a difference.\n\n**Strategies related to my bedtime habits:**\n\nI have a bedtime ritual that starts 1–2 hours before the time I want to be asleep. During this time I focus on things that are calming or otherwise part of my evening routine: Chatting with my partner about our days, noodling with the guitar, packing my gym bag for the next morning, playing with our dogs. I try to avoid doing anything stimulating or stressful like making phone calls, paying bills, etc.\n\nI write things down before bed. I keep a gratitude journal on my nightstand and, every night, write down at least 5 things I was particularly grateful for that day. That helps put me in a relaxed, positive frame of mind for sleeping. I have a separate “worry journal” where I write down everything I need to do or am otherwise fretting about that might keep me awake. I tell myself that I can open the notebook and resume worrying about these things in the morning, but for now, I am closing the notebook and putting them aside. These are both just mindfulness rituals that work for me, but different things work for different people. Other rituals that work for people I know: Writing down their worries on little pieces of paper and burning them with a candle, saying a prayer out loud, meditating, drawing a picture that sums up their day.\n\nI read in bed for up to an hour, in the dark, using either the Instapaper or Kindle apps on my phone with the white-text-on-black-background setting engaged. I hate how some people insist that ALL DEVICES must be verboten before bedtime, or that doing anything in bed — including reading — is a problem. Here’s what I DON’T do for an hour before sleep time (I get in bed at 9pm with the goal of being asleep by 10pm): Surfing the web on my phone or a computer, replying to emails, watching TV, doing anything under bright lights. Here’s what I DO do: Get into bed, turn off the lights, turn off all notifications on my phone, and read a book on my Kindle app with the white-text-on-black-blackground setting engaged. For me, it’s critical to turn off any banner notifications or other distractions that might pop up while I’m reading. All I have access to is the book or article in front of me. I find this helps me fall asleep even more quickly than reading a paper book (or non-backlit Kindle) under dim light. Somehow the total darkness is what signals to my brain that sleep time is coming. I give myself an hour, though, so I am able to relax and lose myself in the story before I start getting anxious that I’m not feeling sleepy yet.\n\nI sleep with earplugs, a white noise machine, and have very dark window shades. I said at the beginning how this was one of the annoying suggestions, but really: Try keeping the room dark and silent or with white noise only. If you close your eyes at night and find it’s darker than when you had them open, then you need to cut off some sources of light. I have shades that block out the streetlights and neighbors’ backyard lighting, and put black electrical tape over chargers and other devices with lights on them. Other people I know use white noise machines in addition to the earplugs.\n\n**Diet-related strategies:**\n\nI don’t drink alcohol. When I was younger I relied on having a glass or two of wine before bed to help me sleep, but the problem with that is that, like any addictive substance, the amount I “needed” kept increasing. Plus, alcohol disrupts your REM sleep and can wake you up in the middle of the night when the effects wear off. I quit drinking for a variety of reasons, but was surprised to find that one of the benefits was how much better I started sleeping (not at first, but after about 6 months).\n\nI make lunch my big meal of the day. This helps me avoid eating a large, high-calorie meal right before bed, which can also interfere with sleep. I look forward to a filling and flavorful lunch as my “big meal.” I also block out my work calendar from 12p-1p weekdays, so people don’t try and schedule meetings during that time, forcing me to just grab something on the run.\n\nCaffeine? This doesn’t apply to me, personally (I drink plenty of coffee!), but some people are particularly sensitive to caffeine due to genetic differences in how they metabolize it. My partner is one of those (I’m not, thank goodness!). He can have a cup of coffee at noon and it will keep him awake 10 or 12 hours later. If you’re reading this, you might try cutting out caffeine temporarily to see if you are one of these people.\n\n**Strategies around medication:**\n\nI took drugs at first, but not Ambien. The two groups of commonly-prescribed drugs, (1) Ambien-type drugs and (2) prescriptions classified as benzodiazapenes (i.e. Xanax, Ativan, Klonopin, etc.) are intended for short-term use and quickly lose effectiveness — and the latter are dangerously addictive. Once I finally found a doctor who took my sleep issues seriously, we set about trying to find a non-addictive medication that could help over the long term and was safe for me to take for months at a time. People I know have found success with a first-generation antidepressant called trazodone, but it gave me terrifyingly realistic nightmares that felt like hallucinations (a known side effect). What worked for me was quetiapine fumarate, which is an anti-psychotic that’s used off-label for insomnia. It comes with significant side effects and requires monitoring, but it was worth the risks for me. I was eventually able to taper off of it, but I took it while I was working on other lifestyle changes to get my insomnia under control. My point is that there are non-addictive, non-Ambien options that are available, but the tough part is finding a doctor who takes you seriously and doesn’t give you the same “try taking a warm bath!” nonsense.\n\nI take melatonin, but I don’t actually know if it does anything. From what I’ve read, melatonin gets destroyed in a person’s stomach, so taking it as a pill that you swallow is much less effective. I get the kind that dissolves under your tongue and take 5mg of it about an hour before bed. I actually don’t know that this helps, but it doesn’t seem to hurt.\n\n_(Update: At 50, I'm now on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and the 200mg progesterone I take at night really helps with falling asleep quickly too!)_\n\n**Strategies related to my lifestyle and way of thinking:**\n\nI have a meditation practice and I make it a priority. Mine is part of a larger Buddhist practice focused on letting go of trying to control the world around me and accepting things as they are, which is helpful in reducing general anxiety and, as a result, insomnia. But even on its own, I think meditation is helpful. I try to meditate every day, even if only for 10 minutes, which helps me practice getting my mind into the place of stillness that is helpful when trying to fall asleep. Meditation is great for learning how to quiet the “noisy voices” that would not stop reminding me of everything I needed to do the next day when I was trying to fall asleep. I find the Buddhify app useful for guided meditation.\n\nI remind myself that not sleeping is not the end of the world. I was raised to think that there were certain rules that had to be followed, and if you followed them all to the letter, your life would be perfect and nothing bad would ever happen to you (that’s how it works, right)? For me, that also applied to getting 8 hours of sleep. If I wasn’t sleeping, I began to have meta-anxiety about getting into bed, and worrying about my insomnia kept me awake. That would’ve been funny if it weren’t so frustrating! Now, when I have the occasional sleepless night, I keep in mind that people with infants, those living in war zones, people who have to work multiple shift jobs, and many others are able to survive on surprisingly small amounts of sleep. Not sleeping for a few nights might make me tired and irritable, and isn’t great for my health, but I will survive, and I will eventually go back to normal sleep patterns. It’s not the end of the world.\n\nI check the calendar. It took me an embarrassingly long time to realize that my occasional bouts with intense anxiety always came 1–3 days before my period was scheduled to start. I still typically only get 4 or 5 hours of very light sleep, waking every hour or so, for at least one night during that time. Knowing that it’s just a hormonal issue and that it will pass in a night or two — and being able to anticipate that it was going to happen — made it easier to tolerate.\n\nI undertook other life changes to address my depression and anxiety. This would be a whole ‘nother post, but I have made many other changes to improve my mental health and which contribute to my feeling more relaxed and less stressed overall, which I have to assume contributed to relieving my insomnia. These include engaging in talk therapy, volunteering, choosing jobs that are not as high-pressure as many in my field, investing in my social safety net by prioritizing making time with old and new friends, and taking steps to simplify my life.\n\nI hope this helps someone. Good night and good luck.\n\n\n\n",

Just tell me what to buy!&rdquo; But the thing is that there are a LOT of features on an e-bike where one choice is no &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the other, it&rsquo;s just a matter of what your preference is.</p>\n<p>Before you go in to ride bikes, these are some parameters and choices you will want to think about:</p>\n<p><em><strong>How fast do you want to go?</strong></em> E-bikes are separated into two different buckets (in California, technically 3 classes): those that are pedal-assist and don&rsquo;t really go more than 20mph, and ones that have a throttle, don&rsquo;t require pedalling, and are essentially mopeds (and go faster than 20mph).</p>\n<p><em><strong>What kind of range do you need on the battery?</strong></em> The longer the range (how far you can go on a single charge), the heavier the battery will be, and usually the more expensive it will be. So I chose to buy the minimum range for my needs (about 25 miles, the way that I use it). Remember that the &ldquo;stronger&rdquo; the pedal assist, and the larger the motor, the more quickly the battery will run out, so a lot will depend on your riding style.</p>\n<p><em><strong>How light do you need the bike to be?</strong></em> The larger the battery and the stronger the motor, the heavier the bike will be. I wanted one that I could carry up stairs if I had to. It&rsquo;s still pretty heavy, but I can carry it for short distances. A lot of models would be too heavy for me to carry at all. Maybe you&rsquo;re okay with that, or you&rsquo;re very strong.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Do you want a cargo bike?</strong></em> Cargo bikes are very useful, but they are heavier, harder to park, and might be overkill if you won&rsquo;t be carrying cargo often. I have 2 collapsible wire panniers on either side of my bike, a back rack, and a front basket, and that usually has enough capacity for anything I carry (but we also have a car if we&rsquo;re buying stuff that&rsquo;s really large).</p>\n<p><em><strong>How much do you want to spend?</strong></em> I started out not wanting to spend more than $2,500, but ended up going up to $4,000 because I LOVED the bike I chose, it met all my needs, and I didn&rsquo;t want to buy a cheaper bike and then want to upgrade in a year because there were too many things I was annoyed about. But there is a HUGE range of pricing, and if that&rsquo;s your top criteria, you can find many useful options under $2,000. You may also want to consider how securely you&rsquo;ll be able to keep the bike (mine stays in my own locked garage, with multiple angle-grinder proof locks securing it to a concrete anchor in the floor, plus the built-in cafe lock) &ndash; if you&rsquo;re in a shared apartment garage, etc., you might go for a less expensive model.</p>\n<p><em><strong>How strong do you need the motor to be (torque)?</strong></em> To answer this question, I recommend testing any bikes on some steep hills. My requirement was that I wanted to be able to get it up the steepest hills of San Francisco, but I&rsquo;m also reasonably athletic and don&rsquo;t mind putting some muscle into it. If where you live is mostly flat, you can get away with a lot less torque.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Will you need to remove the battery to charge it?</strong></em> If you can&rsquo;t park it in a garage overnight where you can plug it in, you&rsquo;ll need to limit yourself to batteries that can be easily removed and taken elsewhere to charge. The nice thing about these models is that you can buy an extra battery, and swap them out immediately when one runs out, rather than waiting to recharge.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Do you want a hub-drive motor or mid-drive motor?</strong></em> This is something you&rsquo;ll only be able to tell by riding the bikes. For me, the mid-drive motor felt much smoother and more comfortable. But it&rsquo;s just a feature to be aware of and maybe read up on.</p>\n<p><em><strong>What annoys you about riding bikes NOW?</strong></em> I found that a lot of e-bike models addressed the factors that often dissuaded me from riding a bike, most notably: (1) my e-bike has a covered chain so I don&rsquo;t need to worry about it ruining my pants, (2) it doesn&rsquo;t have a horizontal bar in the middle so you have to climb onto it, you just step on, and (3) the handlebars are very upright, so I can sit normally on the bike instead of hunching over. Also, we all have differently-shaped and -proportioned bodies, and certain models might just feel more comfortable for you.</p>\n<p>I ended up with a <a href=\"https://www.gazellebikes.com/en-us/ebikes/gazelle-arroyo-c5-elite\">Gazelle Arroyo C5</a>, from <a href=\"https://newwheel.net/?srsltid=AfmBOorL-ZI4UrldvZT0Jq7QwlVHWLfDeWS0cyylFUzRtEYrTRj9Gf6e\">The New Wheel in Bernal Heights</a>.

Also, we all have differently-shaped and -proportioned bodies, and certain models might just feel more comfortable for you. \n\nI ended up with a [Gazelle Arroyo C5](https://www.gazellebikes.com/en-us/ebikes/gazelle-arroyo-c5-elite), from [The New Wheel in Bernal Heights](https://newwheel.net/?srsltid=AfmBOorL-ZI4UrldvZT0Jq7QwlVHWLfDeWS0cyylFUzRtEYrTRj9Gf6e).
